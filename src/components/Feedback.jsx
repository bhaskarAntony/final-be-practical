      "Be-practical is one of the best platforms for all non-technical and technical background students. I did MBA in 2017, and I'm learning lots of things at the institute. I like the faculty, and I feel that I had the very best platform for my career. I learned many new things from my teachers who were very helpful in every way they could. Teachers' and students' interaction was good, and they are very friendly, which helped me clarify many of my doubts in the course. I appreciate the faculty for their quick response and great support, and very special thanks to HR Kavitha Mam; she is very kind, and I am always thankful for her support and guidance. Thank you.",
